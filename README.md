The goal is to predict whether or not a given female patient will contract diabetes based on features such as BMI, age, and number of pregnancies. Therefore, it is a binary classification problem. A target value of 0 indicates that the patient does not have diabetes, while a value of 1 indicates that the patient does have diabetes. In this script we evaluate the performance of binary classifiers by computing a confusion matrix and generating a classification report.
